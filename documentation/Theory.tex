\section{Theoretical principles}


\subsection{Simulation model}

Runoff, soil moisture storage, transpiration and plant-bare soil transitions
are numerically modeled on a lattice of square cells. The model simulates
the following spatially distributed \index{water balance}water balance:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial w_{i}}{\partial t}=P_{i}+R_{i}-Q_{i}-E_{i}-\underset{n}{\sum}T_{n}\label{eq:water-balance}
\end{equation}


\nomenclature[P]{$P$}{precipitation rate in $[\unitfrac{L}{T}]$ (e.g. $\unitfrac{mm}{d}$)}
\nomenclature[R]{$R$}{surface water inflow due to run-on from upslope in $[\unitfrac{L}{T}]$}
\nomenclature[w]{$w$}{local water storage in $[\unit{L}]$}
\nomenclature[t]{$t$}{time in $[\unit{T}]$}
\nomenclature[Q]{$Q$}{surface water discharge as runoff in $[\unitfrac{L}{T}]$}
\nomenclature[E]{$E$}{rate of soil evaporation in $[\unitfrac{L}{T}]$}
\nomenclature[T]{$T$}{transpiration by a plant in $[\unitfrac{L}{T}]$ located at i as well as those in the neghbourhood $(n)$, whose lateral roots extend to that location}
